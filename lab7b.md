## Objectives
The purpose of this lab is to learn about biodiversity by measuring it in the samples we collected from the New Scotland formation earlier this month.

## Introduction
The New Scotland Formation is Early Devonian in age, belongs to the Helderberg Group, and is exposed in eastern New York. (See the figure below)

There are a variety of ways to think about diversity. The simplest, and most common, is to think of diversity simply as the number of species (or genera, families, etc.). This metric is called **species richness** or just **richness**. This is the main metric we will use in this lab.

It is interesting to know how many species there are in a sample, bed, formation, etc. If we have this information, we can then make comparisons (perhaps using [rarefaction](https://github.com/naheim/rTutorials/blob/master/rarefaction.md) or some other sample standardization) between samples, formation, etc. However, we might also want to know how diversity changes through space or time. We can do this by taking a hierarchical approach to measuring biodiversity. 

Modern ecologists often consider the diversity at two levels: local habitat and regional landscape.  diversity. As alluded to above, there are multiple metrics of diversity that can be applied, but we'll stick with simple richness for now. Using richness (often symbolized by *S*) as the measure of diversity, habitat diversity is simply the number of species counted or estimated from a local habitat--the number of ant species on Tuft's Academic Quad for example. This is often called alpha diversity (:alpha:) 

* Rarefaction
* Evenness
* Beta Diversity
* Additive Diversity Partitioning

#### Exercise Questions 1
Search for 'Hindsville' in the search bar at the upper right. This will take you to the summary page for the units named Hindsville.

1. Where is the Hindsville located?

2. What age is the Hindsville? Give the period and stage names.

3. How thick is the Hindsville?

4. Why are there three columns that have Hindsville units?  

5. What proportion of the Hindsville is sandstone?

6. What are the prevalent taxa found in the Hindsville?

Click on the gray polygon that contains the city of Fayetteville. This will take you to the summary page for that column.

7. What is the name of the column?

8. How thick is the column?

9. How many PBDB collections have been matched to units in this column and what are the prevalent taxa?

At the bottom of the page is a graphical rendering of the units within the column.

10. How many packages are in this column and how are the delineated on the figure?

11. How many units have PBDB collections?

12. What are the units above and below the Hindsville? Are each of these units in the same or different packages?
