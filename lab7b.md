## Objectives
The purpose of this lab is to learn about biodiversity by measuring it in the samples we collected from the New Scotland formation earlier this month.

## Introduction
The New Scotland Formation is Early Devonian in age, belongs to the Helderberg Group, and is exposed in eastern New York. (See the figure below)

There are a variety of ways to think about diversity. The simplest, and most common, is to think of diversity simply as the number of species (or genera, families, etc.). This metric is called **species richness** or just **richness**. This is the main metric we will use in this lab.

It is interesting to know how many species there are in a sample, bed, formation, etc. If we have this information, we can then make comparisons (perhaps using [rarefaction](https://github.com/naheim/rTutorials/blob/master/rarefaction.md) or some other sample standardization) between samples, formation, etc. However, we might also want to know how diversity changes through space or time. We can do this by taking a hierarchical approach to measuring biodiversity. 

Modern ecologists often consider the diversity at two levels: local habitat and landscape. As alluded to above, there are multiple metrics of diversity that can be applied, but we'll stick with simple richness for now. Using richness (often symbolized by *S*) as the measure of diversity, habitat diversity is simply the number of species counted or estimated from a local habitat--the number of ant species on Tuft's Academic Quad for example. This is often called alpha diversity (&alpha;). The number of species within the landscape--e.g., the number of ant (:ant:) species in all of Middlesex County--is often called gamma diversity (&gamma;).

It must be true that &alpha; <= &gamma;. The diversity that is added by summing many local habitats to arrive at &gamma; is called turnover diversity or beta diversity (&beta;). In essence, beta diversity tells us how different local habitats are from each other. If local habitats are nearly identical in their species composition, &beta; will be low. If local habitats are all very different from each other, then &beta; will be very high. 

In the geological record, we can apply this model of hierarchical diversity to samples collected in the fossil record.
