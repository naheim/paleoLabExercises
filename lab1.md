## Lab 1: Introduction to the Paleobiology Database and Paleodiversity

## Under development

### Objectives

### The Paleobiology Datbase (PBDB)

### Navigator

### The API & Downloading data--Crinoids
* id resolution
* age resolution
* paleoloc
* taxon\_name & base\_name
* show
* envtype
* timescale

### Convert occurrences to genus data frame

### Writing Loops

### Add diversity metrics to timescale

### Diversity metrics and extinction rates

### Assignment Documents--Stenolaemata

Download All marine crustacean occurrences from the PBDB. Include only genus-level occurrences.

Generate the following plots and answer the following questions. When making plots, always be sure to plot time axis properly and use easy to understand axis labels, when units when appropriate.

1. How many Stenolaemata occurrences, collections, and genera are in the PBDB?
2. Plot occurrences through time
3. Plot genera through time
4. Plot genera vs occurrences
5. Plot extinction rate through time
6. During what stage did the Stenolaemata first appear?
